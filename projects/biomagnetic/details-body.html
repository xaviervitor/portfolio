    Biomagnetic a First-Person Puzzle game about using magnetism to pull and hold heavy and far away objects to solve small puzzles. The character controller consists of standard object holding mechanics, inspired by the Half-Life 2's pickup physics and the gravity gun, but in a more extreme application. At first, the player can only hold small and close objects to get around the level, but once the player gets the Magnetic Bracelet, the core mechanic opens more possibilities.
