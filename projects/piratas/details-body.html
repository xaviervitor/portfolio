    Piratas is a top-down arcade shooter. You control a ship with "tank controls" and can make points by destroying other pirate ships, with the objective of surviving the most time possible. When the player makes enough points, a harder pirate ship, the Ghost Ship, appears. Destroying it has the benefit of recovering part of the player's health, creating a game-loop that encourages constant movement and active seeking of enemies.
